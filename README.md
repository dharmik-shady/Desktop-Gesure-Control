# Desktop_Controller_Using_Hand_Gesture
The proposed system can control Windows desktop using only Hand Gestures that are detected by webcam and perform actions accordingly.

The vision based desktop control using the hand gesture system is developed in the Python language, using the OpenCV, Mediapipe and PyAutoGui library. The system is able to control the movement of a cursor by tracking the userâ€™s hand. Cursor functions are performed by using different hand gestures. The system has the potential of being a viable replacement for the computer mouse.


## Usage

- Gesture: index finger up => Move Pointer
- Gesture: both index and thumb up => clicking mode
- Gesture: both index, Middle and thumb up => ( Slide Vertically-Up => Volume Up ) OR ( Slide Vertically-Down => Volume Down )
